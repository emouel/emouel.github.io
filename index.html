	<h1> About Me</h1>
	

	
	
	
	<h2><p> My name is Mosby and I'm a Pembroke Welsh Corgi.</p>
	</h2> <p>I have a sister, her name is Ella and my mom's name is Ellie. I live with my two cat friends. I also live with my mom, my aunt's, an uncle, and my grandparents. I love eating flowers and taking naps.</p>  <p> I do not enjoy going for walks even though my mom forces me to. Sometimes I enjoy going in the pool, but my Mom makes me wear my life jacket. One of my friends got me my own beach towel with my name on it! </p> 
	<p> Some of my favorite treats are pig ears, minty bones, and milkbones. Some of my favorite toys are balls, my pizza, and anything that I'm not supposed to be playing with. </p> 
	<p>I love going for car rides, especially when I get treats. When we go to the bank, they give me a dog treat. When we go to Tim Hortons, I get some Tim Bits, honey dipped are my favorites. </p>
