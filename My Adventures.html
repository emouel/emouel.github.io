	<h1> My Adventures! </H1>
	<p> On June 15, I moved into my new home with my Mom, Amanda. Since then, I've been to all kinds of fun places! I've gone to York Beach, and the lake, I've seen two different light houses, and I've toured the UMaine Campus! </p>
	<p> This summer I went to the beach with my family. Although I'm not a huge fan of the waves, <b>I love seaweed!</b> I also got to meet all kinds of new dogs. Even though I am a small dog, I still think like a big dog.</p>
