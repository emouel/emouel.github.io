	<h1> My Adventures! </H1>
	<p> On June 15, I moved into my new home with my Mom, Amanda. Since then, I've been to all kinds of fun places! I've gone to York Beach, and the lake, I've seen two different light houses, and I've toured the UMaine Campus! </p>
	<p> This summer I went to the beach with my family. Although I'm not a huge fan of the waves, <b>I love seaweed!</b> I also got to meet all kinds of new dogs. Even though I am a small dog, I still think like a big dog. We went on long walks every morning and then I got to sleep all day. I really enjoy sleeping.</p>
	<p> I went to visit my dog cousin Jack this summer. He lives next to the Cove so whenever I go visit him I get to play in the seaweed. The last time I went, I got covered in fire ants and it was a very traumatic experience. But every time I visit my Auntie Alyssa lets me take some of Jack's toys home with me. Jack also has two dog neighbors that I get to visit with too! </p>
	<p> One of my favorite places to visit is UMaine campus because I get pet by everyone! </p>
